Our goal is to create specifications that enable data scientists to describe analysis tools and workflows that are powerful, easy to use, portable, and support reproducibility.CWL builds on technologies such as JSON-LD and Avro for data modeling and Docker for portable runtime environments. CWL is designed to express workflows for data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.This is v1.0 of the CWL tool and workflow specification, released on 2016-07-08",
